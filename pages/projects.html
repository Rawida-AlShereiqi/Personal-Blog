            The purpose of this project for Sorting out the invalid fruit among the fruits and display this information on the web. Technology we are using in our project is a smart camera which is an advanced and feasible solution to sorting out the invalid fruit.<br>
            To provide a less demanding solution. Camera is used to give a correct analysis of the fruits which we can compare the fruits if it is rotten or fresh. This project helps the farmer and the sellers to have a good quality of fruits and this will help to raise their sales.<br>
             Also. in this project we will use raspberry pi it has shape of credit card, connected to the computer it used because its cheap, small in size and very easy to use. It can do more thing than we accepted from the computer, and it used in many projects around the world such as, detector to weather stations.<br>
            In this project, a circuit was designed and implemented to enable the user to Sort the invalid fruit The circuit is based on using raspberry pi and camera.

            This project focuses on collecting garbage using the technology of sensing the distance if there is an obstacle such as a wall through the ultrasonic sensor.<br>
            It will give an order to the motors to stop because the obstacle is close and it is not possible to move forward. We also used the IR sensor at the end of the arm to sense any garbage that is in front of it.<br>
             In this case, the motors will stop moving and give the two servo in the arm to move at certain angles to raise the arm up and then throw the garbage into the container designated for it.
